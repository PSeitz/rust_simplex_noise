Perlin Simplex Noise Rust Implementation (2D, 3D)
========================================================

## About Perlin's "Simplex" Noise

- Perlin's "Classic" Noise (1984) is an algorithm producing pseudo-random fluctuations
  simulating natural looking variations, producing paterns all of the same size.
  It is a kind of gradiant-noise algorithm, invented by Ken Perlin while working
  on visual special effects for the Tron movie (1982).
  It works by interpolating pseudo-random gradiants defined in a multi-dimensionnal grid.

- Perlin's "Improved" Noise (2002) switches to a new interpolation fonction with
  a 2nd derivative zero at t=0 and t=1 to remove artifacts on integer values,
  and switches to using predefined gradients of unit lenght to the middle of each edges.

- Perlin's "Simplex" Noise (2001) rather than placing each input point into a cubic grid,
  based on the integer parts of its (x,y,z) coordinate values, placed them onto a simplicial grid
  (think triangles instead of squares, pyramids instead of cubes...)

## Coherent noise

A coherent noise is a type of smooth pseudorandom noise with following properties:.
- same input will always return the same output.
- small change of the input will produce small change of the output.
- large change of the input will produce random change of the output.
